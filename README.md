## Introduction

Meaningless Masterpieces serves as a satirical tone against the existing, sometimes snobby, art world. Where even a banana taped to a wall can be worth thousands. So why not take a picture of a random trashcan and sell it off as art yourself?



## Features

- Camera functionalities and image saving
- AI integration for backstory generation
- View and interact with (staggered) galleries of artworks.
- View detailed information about specific artworks.
- Tag and generate titles for photos.
- Swipe mechanics to increase or decrease art value

## Future improvement opportunities

Due to time constraints the posting functionality of putting your taken image into a gallery hasn’t been implemented. We decided that this feature is something that can be implemented in the future. 

Having fully curated art galleries is also something that is a future improvement opportunity. For the concept there are placeholders in place currently.
